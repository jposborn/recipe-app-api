# Recipe API Project

A portfolio project I am working on as part of my Django REST Framework course studies. The API is designed to provide an API for storing recipe details, with my main learning outcomes focused on developing within Docker containers, Python Test Driven Development (including use of GitHub Actions), customizing Django Admin, configuring DRF for use with Postgres, and uploading files with Django.
